  # HepLang
  
  *A small programming language made in Python*
  
</div>

## Why?

Some may think, "why another programming language", and honestly, my answer is "Why not?". I decided to make Heplang for no other reason than that it would be a fun project to work on. I wanted something challenging, and something to improve my experience in a language where I was under-confident, so I chose to make a language, in Python.

## Information

HepLang currently only has an IDLE Shell. In this shell you can execute commands, then run the `build();` command to compile it into a Python binary. The project is a small hobby-project of mine bred from boredom and made for fun.

## Installation

* Currently HepLang has no installation instructions and is meant to be ran in the home directory it was installed in, this is to be changed.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/httpllamaz/heplang
cd heplang/
python3 heplang.py
```

* Currently, the build.egg serves no purpose other than if you wish to change your default binary name from `main` to something else. In the future it should be utilised as build instructions where bits of code can go to certain files.

## Features

- [x] IDLE Shell
- [x] Ability to declare variables
- [x] Print to console
- [x] Print with fstrings
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] Ability to read and compile .hep files
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] While/For statements/loops
- [ ] Give features to the build.egg file in compling to handle multiple .hep files at once.

## Documentation

- The project is a tiny, TINY, hobby project. As it grows I will eventually add documentation but since it's under development that has not stagnated in the ~6 hours I created it, I will add it when development slows down. For now, "The code is the docsâ„¢"
